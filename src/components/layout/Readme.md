The guiding principle for layout is that components should not provide surrounding white space. Instead, spacing between elements is controlled entirely by layout primitives. This approach ensures that the system is as composable as possible while keeping white space completely predictable.

All layout primitives are using the [spacing scale](/#/Foundation?id=section-spacing) instead of exact values. This ensures consistency across all components.
