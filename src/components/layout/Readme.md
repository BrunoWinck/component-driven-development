The guiding principle for layout is that components should not provide surrounding whitespace. Instead, the spacing between elements is controlled entirely by layout primitives. This approach ensures that the system is as composable as possible while keeping the whitespace completely predictable.

All layout primitives are using the [spacing scale](/#/Foundation?id=section-spacing) instead of exact values. This ensures consistency across all components.
